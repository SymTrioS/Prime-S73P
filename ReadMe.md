<h3 align="center">The Prime controller integrates three computing units:</h3>

- a user interface processor with a Linux OS and standard I/O devices;

- a hardware-specific data processing unit based on programmable logic;

- a microcontroller-based analog and digital signal processing unit.
  
<h4 align="center">To facilitate the development and debugging of controller software, the board includes a microcontroller programmer and debugger, a dual-channel USB-to-UART converter, and an interface for configuring programmable logic.</h4>
  
<h4 align="center">Built-in programming, debugging, and monitoring functions are accessible via a USB Type-C connector.</h4>

<h3 align="center">Getting started</h3>

1. Connect the board (USB Type-C connector) with a cable to the computer.

2. Three devices should appear in the computer system:
- a debugger for the CMSYS-DAP-S microcontroller and
- two COM ports (USB-UART converters).

<h5 align="center">The first converter is connected to the UART console of the F1C200S processor via the internal FPGA configuration, as well as the jumpers installed on the board. At the same time, if a USB memory card with a Linux image is installed, then in the terminal window (115200.8,N) you can see information about the boot the operating system, followed by an invitation to enter your username and password (in the case of the Debian12: root/root assembly included in the 'uSD' directory).</h5>

<h5 align="center">The second converter is connected to the microcontroller's UART to output information generated by its control program. In the case of the test program, these are: the values of the cyclically variable voltage DAC-B, the values of the digitized voltage using the ADS1120 input connected by a jumper, and the values obtained from two ADC121 connected to the FPGA.</h5>

3. The test program is available in two IDE versions: IAR (https://github.com/SymTrioS/GD32F303CC_IAR ) and VSC (
https://github.com/SymTrioS/GD32F303CC_VSC 4. The FPGA configuration is set by a test case for the Gowin development environment:
https://github.com/SymTrioS/GW1NR-LV9 5. If necessary, you can use the already prepared files located in the 'Bin' directory: hex file for the firmware of the GD32F303 microcontroller and fs file for FPGA configuration.

6. These files are already embedded in the microcontroller and FPGA, as they are used for testing.

7. When the board is running, you can observe the flashing of custom blue and red LEDs, as well as the green glow when the program accesses the FPGA registers - the readings of two external ADC121.
